Welcome to the Simon Game!

This classic memory game, written in HTML, CSS, and jQuery, will test your memory skills and keep you entertained for hours. The goal of the game is to repeat the sequence of flashing colors displayed by the game. Each round, the sequence becomes longer and more complex, so you'll need to have a sharp memory to keep up.

To play, simply use your mouse or finger to click on the flashing color buttons in the correct order. The game features colorful graphics and smooth animations, making it a pleasure to play.
